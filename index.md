### CPSC 120

* [Lab 4](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-04-joseph-and-natalie/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 4 part 2 was fun, designing a little video game in the terminal. Although quite rudimentary, it was still fun, creating the little dynamic program that it is. It was one of the first programs we made that utilized command line arguments.

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-06-joseph-and-diego/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 6, part 2 was a fun. I love the game of Blackjack and had a great time implementing the hand structures into the program we built for the game. It was one of the first programs that dove heavily into the loop and if-else statements structures. I find loops quite routine at times to implement, but the if and else statements can get tricky with the number of clauses.

* [Lab 9](https://github.com/cpsc-spring-2024/cpsc-120-lab-09b-joseph-and-patrick/tree/main/part-1)
    Lab 9 part 1 was troubling for me to begin with, I thought that I had the whole program laid out correctly and all the pieces together to make it function correctly. I was missing something and that was the difference between getline, and the extraction operator with files. Once that was resolved I felt relieved getting the right output and passing the make tests.
